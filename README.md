This is a holberton school project in which I will be replicating a web design sketch to an actual working webpage. will start by coding the header first. it will be responsive for desktop and mobile. then moving on to the what we do section. some elements are layed out the same for the next project so will try to use resuable elements/classes to reproduce the next section as well titled our results. after that will move on to the contact us then footer. the webpage will be built from scratch in HTML/CSS with no bootstrap or javascript.
